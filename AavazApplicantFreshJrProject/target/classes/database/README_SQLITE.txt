There are 2 sqlite3 databases here. 

UserDB.sql.clean
UserDB.sql.work

They are exact copies of each other.

You should use UserDB.sql.work. When you want a clean database again. Simply 
overwrite the UserDB.sql.work with the UserDB.sql.clean file. 

We recommend installing "DB Browser for SQLite" to view the database. 
You can find it here -> https://sqlitebrowser.org/
